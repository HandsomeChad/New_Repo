### Worthy Quotes for a Life-long Learner

As *Steve Chandler* said in *Reinventing Yourself: How to Become the Person You've Always Wanted to Be*

> “Write down 10 things you would do in your life if you had absolutely no fear. Then pick one of them and do it.” 

and most importantly:

> “Do it badly; do it slowly; do it fearfully; do it any way you have to, but do it.”
